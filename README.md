# GUI-Project

This project is a graphic user-interface fishing rod and reel selector using the software Visual Basic. The purpose of the project is to help users identify which size fishing rods or reels they would need to use based on which species of fish they would like to catch. This is a common problem with many people new to fishing and wanting to give the hobby a try. This project is targeted specifically for casual fishermen and first timers. Most of your first timers and casual fishermen simply want to just catch a fish, and the most important thing to do to begin catching a fish is selecting the correct rod and reel for the fish you would like to catch.

First the user must have Visual Studios downloaded in order to open the Visual Basic application. Then the user will simply open the Visual Studios Solution file (.sln) 

After opening the file the user will click Start in order to run the application and the user will select if they are fishing in Freshwater or Saltwater before it takes them to the next screen asking which species will be targeted. After the user selects a species to catch, a form of that species will pop up with all the information needed in order to help the user catch a fish, including rod and reel suggestions, as well as a hook preference.
